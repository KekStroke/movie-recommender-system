The age distribution appears satisfactory, but outliers exist among those who are too young or too old.

The dataset contains a significant gender imbalance, with a higher number of male users. Despite this, a substantial number of female users are retained.

Genre distribution indicates an adequate representation of movies in each genre. Movies with an unknown genre, occurring only twice, are removed.

Occupation distribution in the dataset is sufficient for each occupation.

Ratings are predominantly clustered around 3 and 4, indicating a common rating trend.

The rating timestamps graph shows a smooth pattern.

Distribution of ratings per movie reveals that some movies were rated very few times, prompting their exclusion from the dataset.

Similarly, ratings per user distribution highlights some users with a minimal number of ratings, leading to their exclusion from the dataset.

The release date distribution reveals outliers among movies that are either too old or too new, warranting their exclusion from the dataset.
